# Planar Dataset
### Static Dataset

We place the trolley at different sites and change the orientation from $0^{\circ}$ to $300^{\circ}$ at an interval of approximately $60^{\circ}$. In total, we collect 42 static datasets, each lasting for around 100 seconds.

We controlled the trolley to move at different speeds and collected fast, medium, and slow datasets. The average speed was respectively 0.49m/s, 0.23m/s and 0.11m/s.
