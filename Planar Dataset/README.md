# Planar Dataset
### Static Dataset

We place the trolley at different sites and change the orientation from $0^{\circ}$ to $300^{\circ}$ at an interval of approximately $60^{\circ}$. In total, we collect 42 static datasets, each lasting for around 100 seconds.



### Dynamic Dataset

we controlled the trolley to move at different speeds and collected fast, medium, and slow datasets. The average speed was respectively 0.49m/s, 0.23m/s and 0.11m/s.
